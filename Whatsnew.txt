      corruption ), it closes all opened tables and leaves a debug info in the letodb_crash.log.

[*] More statistical information is gathered now and passed in response to management
      calls.

[*] Checking of filter expression is much more smart now, this allows to prevent errors
      while moving in filtered table.

[+] New function has been added - leto_IsFltOptim(), it returns .T., if the filter
      for a current workarea is evaluated on the server.

[-] Few important fixes.

      leto_useradd( cUser, cPassword [, cAccess] )
      leto_userpasswd( cUser, cPassword )
      leto_userrights( cUser, cAccess )
      leto_userflush()

    New items added to the server's letodb.ini:

[!] The server works im multithread mode now.
    First thread listen sockets, accept connections and answers to commands,
    which doesn't demand database access and Harbour's VM/stack functions.
    The second answers to all other commands.

[!] DBFNTX support has been added. The driver, which will be used to open a
    table ( DBFCDX or DBFNTX ) is determined at server side from the letodb.ini -
